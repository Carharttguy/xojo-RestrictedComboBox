# xojo-RestrictedComboBox
A ComboBox where you can only type something that corresponds with the list

The ComboBox updates it contents if you type something that is a match within the list. This subclass can be used as a drop in. Only the AddRows is NOT useable as I needed it and made it protected.

License: Do whatever you want with it.
